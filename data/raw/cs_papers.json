    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive contexts\nwhere fairness and inclusivity are critical. Pronoun usage, especially\nconcerning gender-neutral and neopronouns, remains a key challenge for\nresponsible AI. Prior work, such as the MISGENDERED benchmark, revealed\nsignificant limitations in earlier LLMs' handling of inclusive pronouns, but\nwas constrained to outdated models and limited evaluations. In this study, we\nintroduce MISGENDERED+, an extended and updated benchmark for evaluating LLMs'\npronoun fidelity. We benchmark five representative LLMs, GPT-4o, Claude 4,\nDeepSeek-V3, Qwen Turbo, and Qwen2.5, across zero-shot, few-shot, and gender\nidentity inference. Our results show notable improvements compared with\nprevious studies, especially in binary and gender-neutral pronoun accuracy.\nHowever, accuracy on neopronouns and reverse inference tasks remains\ninconsistent, underscoring persistent gaps in identity-sensitive reasoning.

In contrast, we humans can not only naturally identify the\nsemantic categories of sounding sources but also determine their deeply encoded\nspatial attributes, including locations and movement directions. This useful\ninformation can be elucidated by considering specific spatial indicators\nderived from the inherent physical properties of sound, such as loudness or\nfrequency. As prior methods largely ignore this factor, we present SpA2V, the\nfirst framework explicitly exploits these spatial auditory cues from audios to\ngenerate videos with high semantic and spatial correspondence.

Conventional methods either rely on end-to-end RL learning or\nmodular-based policy with topological graph or BEV map as memory, which cannot\nfully model the geometric relationship between the explored 3D environment and\nthe goal image. In order to efficiently and accurately localize the goal image\nin 3D space, we build our navigation system upon the renderable 3D gaussian\n(3DGS) representation. However, due to the computational intensity of 3DGS\noptimization and the large search space of 6-DoF camera pose, directly\nleveraging 3DGS for image localization during agent exploration process is\nprohibitively inefficient. To this end, we propose IGL-Nav, an Incremental 3D\nGaussian Localization framework for efficient and 3D-aware image-goal\nnavigation. Specifically, we incrementally update the scene representation as\nnew images arrive with feed-forward monocular prediction. Then we coarsely\nlocalize the goal by leveraging the geometric information for discrete space\nmatching, which can be equivalent to efficient 3D convolution. When the agent\nis close to the goal, we finally solve the fine target pose with optimization\nvia differentiable rendering.

    "clean_abstract": "image-to-image translation has emerged as a powerful technique in medical imaging, enabling tasks such as image denoising and cross-modality conversion. however, it suffers from limitations in handling out-of-distribution samples without causing performance degradation. to address this limitation, we propose a novel test-time adaptation tta framework that dynamically adjusts the translation process based on the characteristics of each test sample. our method introduces a reconstruction module to quantify the domain shift and a dynamic adaptation block that selectively modifies the internal features of a pretrained translation model to mitigate the shift without compromising the performance on in-distribution samples that do not require adaptation. we evaluate our approach on two medical image-to-image translation tasks: low-dose ct denoising and t1 to t2 mri translation, showing consistent improvements over both the baseline translation model without tta and prior tta methods. our analysis highlights the limitations of the state-of-the-art that uniformly apply the adaptation to both out-of-distribution and in-distribution samples, demonstrating that dynamic, sample-specific adjustment offers a promising path to improve model resilience in real-world scenarios. the code is available at: https:github.comcosbidevsample-aware_tta.",

However, the\npractical application of DLLMs is hindered by a critical architectural\nconstraint: the need for a statically predefined generation length.

    "abstract": "Understanding the memorization and privacy leakage risks in Contrastive\nLanguage--Image Pretraining (CLIP) is critical for ensuring the security of\nmultimodal models. Recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of\nextracting sensitive training examples from diffusion models, with conditional\ndiffusion models exhibiting a stronger tendency to memorize and leak\ninformation. In this work, we investigate data memorization and extraction\nrisks in CLIP through the lens of CLIP inversion, a process that aims to\nreconstruct training images from text prompts. To this end, we introduce\n\\textbf{LeakyCLIP}, a novel attack framework designed to achieve high-quality,\nsemantically accurate image reconstruction from CLIP embeddings. We identify\nthree key challenges in CLIP inversion: 1) non-robust features, 2) limited\nvisual semantics in text embeddings, and 3) low reconstruction fidelity. To\naddress these challenges, LeakyCLIP employs 1) adversarial fine-tuning to\nenhance optimization smoothness, 2) linear transformation-based embedding\nalignment, and 3) Stable Diffusion-based refinement to improve fidelity.\nEmpirical results demonstrate the superiority of LeakyCLIP, achieving over 358%\nimprovement in Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) for ViT-B-16 compared\nto baseline methods on LAION-2B subset. Furthermore, we uncover a pervasive\nleakage risk, showing that training data membership can even be successfully\ninferred from the metrics of low-fidelity reconstructions. Our work introduces\na practical method for CLIP inversion while offering novel insights into the\nnature and scope of privacy risks in multimodal models.",

    "abstract": "Photorealistic talking-head avatars are becoming increasingly common in\nvirtual meetings, gaming, and social platforms. These avatars allow for more\nimmersive communication, but they also introduce serious security risks. One\nemerging threat is impersonation: an attacker can steal a user's\navatar-preserving their appearance and voice-making it nearly impossible to\ndetect its fraudulent usage by sight or sound alone. In this paper, we explore\nthe challenge of biometric verification in such avatar-mediated scenarios. Our\nmain question is whether an individual's facial motion patterns can serve as\nreliable behavioral biometrics to verify their identity when the avatar's\nvisual appearance is a facsimile of its owner. To answer this question, we\nintroduce a new dataset of realistic avatar videos created using a\nstate-of-the-art one-shot avatar generation model, GAGAvatar, with genuine and\nimpostor avatar videos. We also propose a lightweight, explainable\nspatio-temporal Graph Convolutional Network architecture with temporal\nattention pooling, that uses only facial landmarks to model dynamic facial\ngestures. Experimental results demonstrate that facial motion cues enable\nmeaningful identity verification with AUC values approaching 80%.

    "abstract": "The rising popularity of Internet of things (IoT) has spurred technological\nadvancements in mobile internet and interconnected systems. While offering\nflexible connectivity and intelligent applications across various domains, IoT\nservice providers must gather vast amounts of sensitive data from users, which\nnonetheless concomitantly raises concerns about privacy breaches. Federated\nlearning (FL) has emerged as a promising decentralized training paradigm to\ntackle this challenge. This work focuses on enhancing the aggregation\nefficiency of distributed local models by introducing over-the-air computation\ninto the FL framework. Due to radio resource scarcity in large-scale networks,\nonly a subset of users can participate in each training round. This highlights\nthe need for effective user scheduling and model transmission strategies to\noptimize communication efficiency and inference accuracy. To address this, we\npropose an integrated approach to user scheduling and receive beam steering,\nsubject to constraints on the number of selected users and transmit power.\nLeveraging the difference-of-convex technique, we decompose the primal\nnon-convex optimization problem into two sub-problems, yielding an iterative\nsolution. While effective, the computational load of the iterative method\nhampers its practical implementation.

    "clean_abstract": "the rising popularity of internet of things iot has spurred technological advancements in mobile internet and interconnected systems. while offering flexible connectivity and intelligent applications across various domains, iot service providers must gather vast amounts of sensitive data from users, which nonetheless concomitantly raises concerns about privacy breaches. federated learning fl has emerged as a promising decentralized training paradigm to tackle this challenge. this work focuses on enhancing the aggregation efficiency of distributed local models by introducing over-the-air computation into the fl framework. due to radio resource scarcity in large-scale networks, only a subset of users can participate in each training round. this highlights the need for effective user scheduling and model transmission strategies to optimize communication efficiency and inference accuracy. to address this, we propose an integrated approach to user scheduling and receive beam steering, subject to constraints on the number of selected users and transmit power. leveraging the difference-of-convex technique, we decompose the primal non-convex optimization problem into two sub-problems, yielding an iterative solution. while effective, the computational load of the iterative method hampers its practical implementation. to overcome this, we further propose a low-complexity user scheduling policy based on characteristic analysis of the wireless channel to directly determine the user subset without iteration. extensive experiments validate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of aggregation error and learning performance over existing approaches.",

In particular, it is essential to understand when decision-makers\nvoluntarily choose to consult AI tools, which we term decision-maker adoption.\nWe interviewed experts across four domains -- medicine, law, journalism, and\nthe public sector -- to explore current AI use cases and perceptions of\nadoption. From these interviews, we identify key factors that shape\ndecision-maker adoption of AI tools: the decision-maker's background,\nperceptions of the AI, consequences for the decision-maker, and perceived\nimplications for other stakeholders. We translate these factors into an AI\nadoption sheet to analyze how decision-makers approach adoption choices through\ncomparative, cross-domain case studies, highlighting how our factors help\nexplain inter-domain differences in adoption. Our findings offer practical\nguidance for supporting the responsible and context-aware deployment of AI by\nbetter accounting for the decision-maker's perspective.",

    "abstract": "IP fragmentation and TCP segmentation allow for splitting large data packets\ninto smaller ones, e.g., for transmission across network links of limited\ncapacity. These mechanisms permit complete or partial overlaps with different\ndata on the overlapping portions. IPv4, IPv6, and TCP reassembly policies,\ni.e., the data chunk preferences that depend on the overlap types, differ\nacross protocol implementations. This leads to vulnerabilities, as NIDSes may\ninterpret the packet differently from the monitored host OSes.

The first contribution of the paper is\nPYROLYSE, an audit tool that exhaustively tests and describes the reassembly\npolicies of various IP and TCP implementation types. This tool ensures that\nimplementations reassemble overlapping chunk sequences without errors. The\nsecond contribution is the analysis of PYROLYSE artifacts. We first show that\nthe reassembly policies are much more diverse than previously thought. Indeed,\nby testing all the overlap possibilities for n <= 3 test case chunks and\ndifferent testing scenarios, we observe from 14 to 20 different behaviors out\nof 23 tested implementations depending on the protocol. Second, we report eight\nerrors impacting one OS, two NIDSes, and two embedded stacks, which can lead to\nsecurity issues such as NIDS pattern-matching bypass or DoS attacks. A CVE was\nassigned to a NIDS error. Finally, we show that implemented IP and TCP policies\nobtained through chunk pair testing are usually inconsistent with the observed\ntriplet reassemblies. Therefore, contrarily to what they currently do, NIDSes\nor other network traffic analysis tools should not apply n = 2 pair policies\nwhen the number of overlapping chunks exceeds two.",

Nowadays, CXL-based heterogeneous memory (CXL-HM) is emerging due to\nits high efficiency and memory semantics.

Additionally,\nexisting CXL-HM page-level data placement schemes are not efficient for\ntree-structure indexes due to the granularity mismatch between the tree nodes\nand the page.\n  In this paper, we argue for a CXL native, tree-structure aware data placement\nscheme to optimize tree-structure indexes on CXL-HM.

    "title": "Automated Type Annotation in Python Using Large Language Models",
    "abstract": "Type annotations in Python enhance maintainability and error detection.\nHowever, generating these annotations manually is error prone and requires\nextra effort. Traditional automation approaches like static analysis, machine\nlearning, and deep learning struggle with limited type vocabularies, behavioral\nover approximation, and reliance on large labeled datasets. In this work, we\nexplore the use of LLMs for generating type annotations in Python. We develop a\ngenerate check repair pipeline: the LLM proposes annotations guided by a\nConcrete Syntax Tree representation, a static type checker (Mypy) verifies\nthem, and any errors are fed back for iterative refinement. We evaluate four\nLLM variants: GPT 4oMini, GPT 4.1mini (general-purpose), and O3Mini, O4Mini\n(reasoning optimized), on 6000 code snippets from the ManyTypes4Py benchmark.\nWe first measure the proportion of code snippets annotated by LLMs for which\nMyPy reported no errors (i.e., consistent results): GPT 4oMini achieved\nconsistency on 65.9% of cases (34.1% inconsistent), while GPT 4.1mini, O3Mini,\nand O4Mini each reached approximately 88.6% consistency (around 11.4%\nfailures).

Our results\ndemonstrate that general-purpose and reasoning optimized LLMs, without any task\nspecific fine tuning or additional training can be effective in generating\nconsistent type annotations.They perform competitively with traditional deep\nlearning techniques which require large labeled dataset for training.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a new approach for fine-tuning the predictions of\nstructured state space models (SSMs) at inference time using real-time\nrecurrent learning. While SSMs are known for their efficiency and long-range\nmodeling capabilities, they are typically trained offline and remain static\nduring deployment. Our method enables online adaptation by continuously\nupdating model parameters in response to incoming data. We evaluate our\napproach for linear-recurrent-unit SSMs using a small carbon emission dataset\ncollected from embedded automotive hardware.

    "abstract": "In high-stakes engineering applications, optimization algorithms must come\nwith provable worst-case guarantees over a mathematically defined class of\nproblems. Designing for the worst case, however, inevitably sacrifices\nperformance on the specific problem instances that often occur in practice. We\naddress the problem of augmenting a given linearly convergent algorithm to\nimprove its average-case performance on a restricted set of target problems -\nfor example, tailoring an off-the-shelf solver for model predictive control\n(MPC) for an application to a specific dynamical system - while preserving its\nworst-case guarantees across the entire problem class. Toward this goal, we\ncharacterize the class of algorithms that achieve linear convergence for\nclasses of nonsmooth composite optimization problems. In particular, starting\nfrom a baseline linearly convergent algorithm, we derive all - and only - the\nmodifications to its update rule that maintain its convergence properties. Our\nresults apply to augmenting legacy algorithms such as gradient descent for\nnonconvex, gradient-dominated functions; Nesterov's accelerated method for\nstrongly convex functions; and projected methods for optimization over\npolyhedral feasibility sets.

Generating the spatial correlation in scenarios\nrequires the design of common factors for neighboring wind farms and\nantithetical factors for distant wind farms. The generalized dynamic factor\nmodel (GDFM) can extract the common factors through cross spectral density\nanalysis, but it cannot closely imitate waveforms. The GAN can synthesize\nplausible samples representing the temporal correlation by verifying samples\nthrough a fake sample discriminator. To combine the advantages of GDFM and GAN,\nwe use the GAN to provide a filter that extracts dynamic factors with temporal\ninformation from the observation data, and we then apply this filter in the\nGDFM to represent both spatial and frequency correlations of plausible\nwaveforms. Numerical tests on the combination of GDFM and GAN have demonstrated\nperformance improvements over competing alternatives in synthesizing wind power\nscenarios from Australia, better realizing plausible statistical\ncharacteristics of actual wind power compared to alternatives such as the GDFM\nwith a filter synthesized from distributions of actual dynamic filters and the\nGAN with direct synthesis without dynamic factors.",
